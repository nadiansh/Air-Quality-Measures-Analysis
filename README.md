# Air Quality Measures Analysis

This project explores air quality data from the **National Environmental Health Tracking Network (NEHTN)**. It includes data wrangling, visualization, and insight generation focused on pollutant measurements across different regions.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Understand pollutant levels and distribution.
- Identify regions with higher concentrations.
- Explore temporal trends in air quality data.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Air_Quality_Measures.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all analysis.
- `data/`: Folder for raw or cleaned datasets.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## 💡 Skills Learned

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Insight extraction from environmental health data
- Version control using Git and GitHub

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## 🔍 Key Insights
- PM2.5 levels vary significantly by state, with certain states consistently showing higher concentrations, indicating a potential link to industrial activity or urban density.
- Seasonal variation was observed, where PM2.5 concentrations tend to spike during the colder months — likely due to increased heating activity and weather conditions that trap pollutants.
